                        <p><span class="badge bg-pink">14</span> <b>Why I am having alerts when inspecting source?</b></p>
                        <p>This is working as it always has since `.load()` was created. The warning is coming from the browser, not jQuery. The API is guaranteeing that if you attempted to use the loaded HTML in the line of JavaScript after the `.load()` it would be available. If the request is changed to an async request, jQuery can no longer guarantee that the loaded HTML is available. Worse, there is no mechanism available via `.load()` to indicate when the HTML has been loaded.</p>
                        <p>TIf you do not want to receive this warning from the browser, you will need to rewrite the `.load()` call as an async `jQuery.ajax()` call that injects the HTML into the document. I cannot change `.load()` in a minor version since it is a breaking change. It's not even clear whether it makes sense to try and fix this. <br><b>Please note:</b> This alerts in no way affect the proper functioning of the site, features and optimization</p>
