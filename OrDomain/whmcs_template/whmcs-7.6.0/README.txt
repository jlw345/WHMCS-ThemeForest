Steps to install WHMCS Template
==============================================
1. Upload the "OrDomainWHMCS" folder to your WHMCS Folder /templates

2. Activate "OrDomainWHMCS" Template from WHMCS Admin Panel Setup

3. Refresh the Client Area

Notes
==============================================

To update the WHMCS template Header and footer, Open "header.tpl" and "footer.tpl" inside "/OrDomainWHMCS" folder and edit accordingly. All the css overrides in "css/style_ordomain.css" file.

If you like to rename WHMCS template folder name, just use only letters and numbers (according to WHMCS).
For example "myhost" is OK. But "my-host" is not OK (WHMCS will be unable to see the specific template in admin).
